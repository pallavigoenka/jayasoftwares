                        In 2007, we developed the website of the Eastern Region Corrugated Box Manufacturersâ€™
                        Association (<a href="http://www.eicbma.com">www.eicbma.com</a>) â€“ which included the unique

                        industry related information in India.<br/><br/>
                        EICMA organized the national conference for the industry in 2009 for which Jaya Softwares did
                        the conference website (<a

                        exhibitor data
                        management. This website became the benchmark for all annual conferences organized by different
                        regions as per their turn. We were invited to develop the conference websites for other
                        associations of the industry such as the North India Corrugated Box Manufacturers Association
                        (December 2011) and the Western India Corrugated Box Manufacturers Association (December
                        2012).<br/><br/>
                        Continuing the success of these projects â€“ we were approached by the Indian Corrugated Case
                        Manufacturersâ€™ Association (ICCMA) for providing web solutions for their various activities. We
                        initially developed the ICCMA website (<a href="http://www.iccma.com">www.iccma.com</a>) and an
